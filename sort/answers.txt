sort1 uses: Bubble Sort

How do you know?:
Random Time: 0m10.013s
Sorted Time: 0m2.137s
Reversed Time: 0m7.883s

This program was slower sorting the reversed and randomized file, however was faster when sorting a sorted file, so this file must be Bubble sort.

sort2 uses: Merge Sort

How do you know?:
Random Time: 0m2.484s
Sorted Time: 0m1.663s

Since this program is the fastest at sorting, both the randomized and the sorted text file, it should be the Merge sorting algorithm, since it runs in Î˜(log n)

sort3 uses: Selection Sort

How do you know?:
Random Time: 0m5.153s
Sorted Time: 0m4.779s
Reversed Time: 0m5.079s

The time this program took to sort a sorted file was pratically the same as the time it took to sort a reversed file. Since this program is slower than sort2, this program must be Selection sort.
